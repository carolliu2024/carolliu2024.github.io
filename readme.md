# Three adjectives that describe the feeling you want for your site

Bubbly, welcoming, comforting

# What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

I learned how to combine several CSS animations together in one element, and learned how to make a button scroll down to a specific div.

# Glitch handles of people in class you got help from, and their help

None

# Assets you got from online and why you have permission to include them

None, all were pictures taken from me or drawn by me.

If font counts as an asset though, the font is Questrial from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Questrial?preview.size=18&query=questrial), and is licensed under the Open Font License.
